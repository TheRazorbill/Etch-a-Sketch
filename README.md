# Project Title: Dynamic Etch-a-Sketch

A web-based sketching application inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. This project was built to practice fundamental web development skills, particularly JavaScript DOM manipulation, CSS Flexbox for layout, and handling user events.

Key Features:

Customizable Grid: Start with a default 16x16 grid, and generate a new grid of any size up to 100x100 with the click of a button.

Interactive Drawing: The grid squares change color when you hover over them, leaving a pixelated trail.

Advanced Coloring Modes:

Random RGB: Each square is filled with a random color upon the first interaction.

Progressive Darkening: Each subsequent hover on the same square increases its opacity by 10%, making it fully colored after ten passes.

Technologies Used:

HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox)

JavaScript (ES6+)

What I Learned: This project was a great exercise in manipulating the DOM dynamically, creating and appending a large number of elements, and managing event listeners. It also helped solidify my understanding of CSS Flexbox for creating responsive grid layouts and handling stateful interactions on individual elements.
